# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Since 2017, I've been devoting 1/3 of my day and a part of my ðŸ–¤ to testing and quality. I've worked in 3 human languages (Polish, English, French) and in 3 programming ones (JavaScript, C#, Python). I speak at conferences, mentor and train, create social media content. I've tested all possible learning methods on myself and made many errors so that my students don't have repeat them!
